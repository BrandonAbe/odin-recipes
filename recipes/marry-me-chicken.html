            <h1>Directions:</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil and melt the butter on medium heat. Swirl pan to coat with oil and butter evenly.</li>
                <li>Brown the chicken (do not overcrowd and work in batches if needed) for 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer onto a plate, cover, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Saute the garlic for a minute or until it's fragrant. Add the chicken stock, and deglaze the pan scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>Adjust the heat to medium-low, and add the heavy cream and the parmesan cheese to the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes, then season with chili flakes, thyme, and oregano.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to your taste, add the sundried tomatoes then put the chicken back in the sauce and let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few more minutes.</li>
                <li>Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves and serve warm over pasta or rice.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
