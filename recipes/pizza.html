        <p>Pizza, a beloved dish originating from Italy, has become a global culinary phenomenon. Characterized by a thin, doughy crust topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and a variety of toppings, pizza offers a delicious and customizable dining experience. Traditional Italian pizzas often feature simple yet flavorful toppings such as fresh tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, and olive oil. However, the versatility of pizza has led to countless variations around the world, with toppings ranging from classic pepperoni and mushrooms to more unconventional options like pineapple and barbecue chicken. Whether enjoyed at a pizzeria, made at home, or grabbed on the go, pizza is a universally loved comfort food that continues to bring joy to people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>
        
        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (9g) active dry yeast or instant yeast, or 1 packet active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (18g) table salt</li>
            <li>2 cups (454g) water, lukewarm</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (25g) olive oil, optional</li>
            <li>5 1/2 to 6 cups (660g to 720g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or 5 1/2 to 6 cups (682g to 744g) King Arthur Pizza Flour Blend, enough to make a soft, smooth dough</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (12g) King Arthur Pizza Dough Flavor, optional</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h1>Directions:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Dissolve the sugar, yeast, and salt in the lukewarm water (and olive oil, if you're using it). </li>
            <li>Add the flour and Pizza Dough Flavor, starting with 5 1/2 cups (660g) flour and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough (with your hands, a mixer, or your bread machine set on the dough cycle) until it's smooth and elastic, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your schedule.</li>
            <li>Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces, for medium-crust pizza; or three pieces, for thicker crusts. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into a circle to fit a 12" pizza pan. Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative. If you prefer a more artisan look to your crust, with scattered random air pockets throughout, hand-stretch the dough to size. Again, letting it rest periodically makes the job easier.</li>
            <li>Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F. While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared ahead. Some possibilities include sliced pepperoni; sautéed mushrooms, onions, or peppers; cooked meats; olives; anchovies; and grated or shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their favorite toppings. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizzas from the oven.</li>
            <li>Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their bottoms don't get soggy. After about 10 minutes (to allow the toppings to set), slice and serve; a pair of scissors is a great cutting tool.</li>
        </ul>
