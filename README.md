This is the Recipes project for The Odin Project. The intent of this repo is to display all of the 
HTML knowledge I have acquired so far from the Foundations course as of April 2024. Some topics covered are:
1) Boilerplate
2) Headings
3) Paragraphs
4) Emphasis and strong text formatting
5) Use of comments to describe sections of program for readability
6) Anchors (links) to both images and other web pages using relative paths
